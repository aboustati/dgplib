# dgplib
Library for Deep Gaussian Processes based on GPflow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aboustati/dgplib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aboustati/dgplib)

## About the Project:

The primary aim of this project is to develop a codebase to allow for fast
prototyping of deep (or hierarchical) Gaussian Process models. At the
moment, this library is meant to be for my own use during my PhD as well as way for me to learn more about research software engineering; however, if
there is enough interest, I am open to making it usable for the wider
community.

Please feel free to submit any issues or pull requests!
